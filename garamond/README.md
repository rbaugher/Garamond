Garamond is an application which is a little bit of everything. I wanted a place that I could host a lot of disparate thoughts and have some fun doing it! Garamond combines interactive gameplay with aspirations for bucket list items (i.e. Everest Base Camp!) with other outdoor activities and goals for the upcoming year.

Within the Game Play engine there are several games which are custom tweaks to classic favorites and several that are just classic favorites! I will continue to add to this arsenal with anything and everything I can come up with :)

The backend of the application is linked to a MongoDB which holds all of the user data and game metrics that are not hosted locally. The connection to this DB will allow for users to see leaderboards and provide feedback

latest changes:
11/28 - Updated the audio file for the rocket ship in asteroids
	  - Updated the font weight of the text on the main page
	  - Optimized asteroids for mobile game play (still some work left to do here)
